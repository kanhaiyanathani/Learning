https://www.typing.com/student/lessons - This is a great website to practice your typing, primarily best for learning to type without looking at keyboard  
Best for learning:
- finger placement
- accuracy
- speed
- trophies and certificates whenever you acheive certain milestone
- game like enviornment

I also use https://www.livechat.com/typing-speed-test/#/ occasaionaly just to measure my speed outside of typing.com  

Below is my results for my typings
