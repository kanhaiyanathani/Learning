The basic components of a Machine Learning (ML) system design include:

1. Data Collection: The first step in designing an ML system is to collect the data that the system will be trained on. The data should be relevant to the problem that the system is intended to solve, and it should be diverse enough to represent the variability of the real-world scenarios.
2. Data Preprocessing: The data collected is often raw and unstructured. Therefore, it needs to be processed and transformed into a format that can be easily fed into the ML model. This involves tasks such as data cleaning, feature extraction, feature normalization, and feature selection.
3. Model Selection: The next step is to select an appropriate ML model that can effectively solve the problem at hand. This involves choosing a model architecture, defining hyperparameters, and evaluating the model's performance on the training data.
4. Model Training: The ML model is trained on the preprocessed data using an algorithm that iteratively adjusts the model parameters to minimize the error between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs.
5. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on a separate set of data that was not used during the training process. This is done to ensure that the model can generalize well to new, unseen data.
6. Model Deployment: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it is deployed in a production environment where it can be used to make predictions on new data. This involves integrating the model into a larger software system, setting up an interface for user interaction, and monitoring the model's performance over time.
7. Model Maintenance: Finally, the ML system needs to be maintained over time to ensure that it continues to perform well. This involves monitoring the performance of the model, collecting feedback from users, and updating the model as new data becomes available or as the problem domain changes.

### Serverless Computing:
Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider allocates machine resources on demand, taking care of the servers on behalf of their customers. "Serverless" is a misnomer in the sense that servers are still used by cloud service providers to execute code for developers.
